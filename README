Automate Sketchup by:
- Using Sphinx4 for voice recognition with custom grammer
- Use sketchup ruby plugin to create browser window to load rails-app page
- Rails-app page creates websocket to create persistant connection to sketchup process
- Rails-app uses sphinx4 java bindings to listen to microphone and parse out commands
- Commands are sent via websocket to ruby plugin and executed via local methods that implement commaands


Command structure prototype:
- "Draw cube 10 by 50 by 400" -> draws cube with x-axis=10", z-axis=50", y-axis=400", leaves new construct selected
- "Label A" -> Labels the selected objects as a component with name 'A'
